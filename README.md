## Introduction üëã

Functions are an essential part of the Python programming language. A **function is a block of code defined with a name**. We use functions whenever we need to perform the same task multiple times without writing the same code again. It can take arguments and returns the value.

Python has a DRY principle like other programming languages. DRY stands for Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself. Consider a scenario where we need to do some action/task many times. We can define that action only once using a function and call that function whenever required to do the same activity.

Function improves efficiency and reduces errors because of the reusability of a code. Once we create a function, we can call it anywhere and anytime. The benefit of using a function is reusability and modularity.

## Frequently asked questions ‚ùî

### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial? üå∑

You can ‚≠ê star this tutorial. Starring is free for you, but it tells me and other people that it was helpful and you like this tutorial.

Go [here](https://github.com/milaan9/05_Python_Files) if you aren't here already and click the "‚≠ê Star" button in the top right corner. You will be asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? ü§î

1. Go [here](https://github.com/milaan9/05_Python_Files) if you aren't here already.
    
2. Click the big green "Clone or download" button in the top right of the page, then click "[Download ZIP](https://github.com/milaan9/05_Python_Files/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)".

3. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.
    
4. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    `Cell > All Output > Clear`
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
